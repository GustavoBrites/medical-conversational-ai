# Personal Project Evaluation

Reference: The [evaluation criteria](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/blob/main/project.md#evaluation-criteria) of the [LLM-zoomcamp course](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp) (as of 08/10/2024).

08/10/2024: Total: 17 / 21 points 

- âœ… Problem description
  - [ ] 0 points: The problem is not described
  - [ ] 1 point: The problem is described but briefly or unclearly
  - [x] 2 points: The problem is well-described and it's clear what problem the project solves

- âœ… RAG flow
  - [ ] 0 points: No knowledge base or LLM is used
  - [ ] 1 point: No knowledge base is used, and the LLM is queried directly
  - [x] 2 points: Both a knowledge base and an LLM are used in the RAG flow

- âœ… Retrieval evaluation:
  - [ ] 0 points: No evaluation of retrieval is provided
  - [x] 1 point: Only one retrieval approach is evaluated
  - [ ] 2 points: Multiple retrieval approaches are evaluated, and the best one is used

- âœ… RAG evaluation:
  - [ ] 0 points: No evaluation of RAG is provided
  - [ ] 1 point: Only one RAG approach (e.g., one prompt) is evaluated
  - [x] 2 points: Multiple RAG approaches are evaluated (**2 prompts**), and the best one is used

- âœ… Interface
  - [ ] 0 points: No way to interact with the application at all
  - [ ] 1 point: Command line interface, a script, or a Jupyter notebook
  - [x] 2 points: API

- âœ… Ingestion pipeline
  - [ ] 0 points: No ingestion
  - [ ] 1 point: Semi-automated ingestion of the dataset into the knowledge base, e.g., with a Jupyter notebook
  - [x] 2 points: Automated ingestion with a **Python script**

- âœ… Monitoring:
  - [ ] 0 points: No monitoring
  - [ ] 1 point: User feedback is collected OR there's a monitoring dashboard
  - [x] 2 points: User feedback is collected and there's a dashboard with at least 5 charts

- âœ… Containerization:
  - [ ] 0 points: No containerization
  - [ ] 1 point: Dockerfile is provided for the main application OR there's a docker-compose for the dependencies only
  - [x] 2 points: Everything is in docker-compose

- âœ… Reproducibility:
  - [ ] 0 points: No instructions on how to run the code, the data is missing, or it's unclear how to access it
  - [ ] 1 point: Some instructions are provided but are incomplete, OR instructions are clear and complete, the code works, but the data is missing
  - [x] 2 points: Instructions are clear, the dataset is accessible, it's easy to run the code, and it works. The versions for all dependencies are specified.

- ðŸš§ Best practices:
  - [ ] Hybrid search: combining both text and vector search (at least evaluating it) (1 point)
  - [ ] Document re-ranking (1 point)
  - [ ] User query rewriting (1 point)

- âœ… Bonus points (not covered in the course)
  - [ ]  Deployment to the cloud (2 points)
